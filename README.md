# Symfony Rainbow Form Recipes

This repository contains the set of recipes that can be found in the [Symfony Framework Form Recipes book](https://leanpub.com/symfonyframeworkrecipes-forms).

Each recipe directory contains a stand-alone standard Symfony framework edition, with the actual code inside the `Rainbow\FrameworkBundle` directory.

You are free to use the recipe code under the BSD-3 license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information). Any other code, including the Symfony2 framework, is licensed under their respective licenses.

I'm happy to accept PR's on bugfixes and incorporate them into the book as well if needed.
